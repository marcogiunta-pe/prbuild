    question: "What do I get with my first free release?",
    answer: "Your first press release includes everything: professional AI-assisted writing, review by our 16-persona journalist panel, unlimited revisions until you're happy, publication to our showcase, and distribution to journalists in your industry. No credit card required."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from PRWeb or PR Newswire?",
    answer: "Wire services distribute to syndication networks (mostly junk sites). We focus on quality: every release is critiqued by our journalist panel before you see it, ensuring it's actually newsworthy. Then we distribute to real journalists who've opted in for your category."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not happy with my press release?",
    answer: "We offer unlimited revisions until you're satisfied. Our panel feedback helps you understand exactly what journalists look for, and our team will keep refining until you approve. If you're still not happy, we'll refund your purchase—no questions asked."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to get my press release?",
    answer: "Most releases are ready for your review within 24-48 hours. After you submit your news details, our team writes the draft, runs it through our journalist panel, and sends you everything with actionable feedback. Rush delivery is available on Pro plans."
  },
  {
    question: "Who are the 16 journalist personas?",
    answer: "Our journalist personas are AI models trained on real journalist preferences across different beats: tech, business, lifestyle, local news, trade publications, and more. Each persona evaluates your release from their specific perspective, providing feedback on newsworthiness, clarity, and what would make them actually cover your story."

  {
    question: "What does the pickup rate mean?",
    answer: "Pickup rate measures journalist engagement within 7 days of distribution. This includes opens, clicks, replies, and coverage. The industry average for wire services is around 2%. Our higher rate comes from sending releases only to journalists who specifically requested news in your category."
